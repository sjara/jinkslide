# jinkslide
Javascript modules for making SVG presentations (based on JessyInk v2).

JinkSlide is a fork of JessyInk 2.0.0 (https://code.google.com/p/jessyink/). It adds a few missing features, including slide overview.

This software is easier to use with the SVG editor Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/). It is currently distributed as an SVG file that includes a simple presentation and all the javascript modules (attached to SVG objects). To use it:

1. Make a copy of jinkslide.svg and name it according to your presentation.
2. Open this new file with Inkscape.
3. Create one SVG layer per slide, and save.
4. Open the file with a browser.
